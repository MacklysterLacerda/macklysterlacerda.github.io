   abstract = {This work delves into LCC-LCC inductive power transfer (IPT) for in-motion electric vehicle charging, also known as dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT). Utilizing Ansys Maxwell software, coupling factor values are determined for rectangular-shaped inductors, considering lateral and vertical misalignments between primary (road-based) and secondary (vehicle-based) coils. The analysis of vehicle motion is accomplished through changes in the coupling factor. Matlab simulations are employed to evaluate IPT power and efficiency concerning misalignments, vehicle bus voltage, and vehicle speed. Efficiency is calculated using power measurements of the primary and secondary DC bus, and losses are attributed to the IPT inductor's resistances. Results show over 90 % efficiency for 2-14 kW power, depending on coupling and vehicle bus voltage.},
