<strong>Title (English):</strong> Wind Energy Generation for Residential Condominiums in Urban Areas
</p>

<p>
<strong>Abstract:</strong> The distributed generation process is already a reality in several countries, now also in Brazil.
Decentralization of power generation reduces losses due to distribution, as well as adding robustness to
the local power system. The distributed generation is characterized in the majority by micro generation in
residences and condominiums, using renewable energies like biomass, photovoltaic and wind power. In
this article we will discuss the feasibility of installing a wind generator in residential condominiums with
an average height of 60 meters in the region with the highest concentration of buildings in the city of
Vitória in Espírito Santo. The wind velocity history between the years 2010 to 2013 was analyzed with
periodic samples at intervals of one hour, comparisons were made between modal, mean and CRM ( cubic
root mean) velocities, calculation of the maximum generated energy per square meter in monthly and
annual distribution, choice of wind turbine, calculation of the maximum energy supplied by the turbine and
financial return.</p>
