This study provides a detailed analysis of bidirectional inductive power transfer (IPT) systems using LCC-LCC compensation topology. It aims to contribute to the field by offering a unified framework that includes mathematical models for both time and frequency domains, accounting for the resistance of all passive components. This research introduces a concise state-space model with voltage inputs and develops conductance equations related to transferred power and losses. These conductances are used to determine the inductor currents, capacitor voltages, active and reactive powers, and efficiency relative to the primary and secondary voltages. The effectiveness of the proposed models is demonstrated through a comparison with simulation results based on a 1.5-kW LCC-LCC IPT system design, showing precise agreement.
