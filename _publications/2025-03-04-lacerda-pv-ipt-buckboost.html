<p>
Inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, when integrated with photovoltaic (PV) generation, typically use a DC–DC converter to decouple the generation and transmission stages, requiring two controllers: one for PV MPPT and another to adjust the IPT’s operating point by tracking either frequency or load resistance. Frequency tracking generally requires a wireless communication link between the IPT’s primary and secondary sides, while load resistance tracking demands an additional DC–DC converter at the load. Both approaches increase system intricacy by adding components to the primary side and/or requiring two DC–DC converters, which hinder modularity and raise costs.
As an alternative, this study proposes a simplified PV–IPT integration by directly connecting a PV to a series–series IPT and using a single buck-boost converter at the load for control. This approach reduces the number of components on the primary side, decreases the power conversion stages from four to three, and uses a single controller for both the PV and IPT. These changes simplify the design, improve energy transfer efficiency, enhance modularity, and reduce control complexity.
The operational points of the PV–IPT system are analyzed in terms of resistance values, with results showing that the implemented MPPT control identifies an intermediate operating point between the PV and IPT power peaks. Experimental data using a 100 W PV indicate that the system’s efficiency is primarily constrained by the IPT’s and buck-boost converter’s efficiencies, both achieving about 86%. The maximum transferred power and overall efficiency observed are approximately 40 W and 60%, respectively.

<!-- This study presents a novel integration of a photovoltaic module with an IPT system using a single buck‑boost converter at the load for MPPT and IPT control. Experimental validation with a 100 W PV module showed simplified topology, modular design, ~60% overall efficiency and 40 W maximum power transfer. -->
